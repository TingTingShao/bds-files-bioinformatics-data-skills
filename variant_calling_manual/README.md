# NGS variant calling workflow           
## Case          
Two exome sequencing samples of a T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patient. One sample `TLE66_T` is of tumor, one healthy control sample `TLE66_N`
## Goal: process the raw fastq, call & annotate SNPs.
We want to ultimately find interesting variants that may be causal to the T-ALL.
